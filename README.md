# py-optDMD
A Python implementation of code for computing optimized DMD.
This code is a numpy/scipy implementation of optimized DMD, written directly from a MATLAB version by Travis Askham, available here: https://github.com/duqbo/optdmd

The code aims to implement optimized DMD as described in "Variable Projection Methods for an Optimized Dynamic Mode Decomposition" by Askham and Kutz.

Currently, it has been checked that it reproduces the DMD modes and eigenvalues from the very first simple example given in Askham's code.

All additional bugs and errors are my own.
