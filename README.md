# Modelling from measurements - homework's solutions
This repository contains the code for the solution of the "homework", for the course of "Modelling from measurements", held by professor Nathan Kutz in Politecnico di Milano (June 2022). 

First 3 questions are developed in MATLAB environment, the other ones in Python

To run the Python code two packages among the others, TensorFlow and PySINDy, are necessary.

I'd like to thank professor Kutz for the lectures he gave us with so much passion. 
I really hope I will have the opportunity to use these powerful tools in my future works.
